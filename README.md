The full project was a class assingment with four students. Two made a game clone of Wordle; another classmate and I made spelling bee. 
I worked on the model and view packeges. This project has no push and merge history because of issues importing it 
from my college's github team, but we used github to commit and collaborate throughout the project. 

Ultimately I ended up copying the files from the original project and pasting them into a new repository.

Specific coding credits (i.e. which classes I worked on) can be found at the top of each class. lelder is me.
